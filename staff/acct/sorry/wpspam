WordPress, the blog software used on your site, was allowing comments
without CAPTCHAs or other forms of anti-spam protection, and therefore
being abused by spambots. Spam has been increasing on those pages and
this would otherwise also result in many unnecessary email
spam-filled messages to be sent from our server.
